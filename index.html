                            The Third Punic War was the third and last of the
                            Punic Wars between Carthage and Rome, and lasted
                            from 149 to 146 BC. The war was fought in what is
                            now northern Tunisia. In 149 BC anti-Carthaginian
                            factions in Rome manufactured a pretext for war. The
                            Carthaginians surrendered all of their weapons, but
                            the Romans pressed on to besiege the city of
                            Carthage (siege engine depicted). The Romans
                            suffered repeated setbacks. A new Roman commander
                            took over in 148 BC, and fared equally badly. Scipio
                            Aemilianus was appointed commander in Africa for 147
                            BC; he tightened the siege and prevented supplies
                            from entering. He then destroyed Carthage's field
                            army and forced the remaining pro-Carthaginian towns
                            to surrender. In spring 146 BC the Romans launched
                            their final assault, systematically destroying the
                            city and killing its inhabitants; 50,000 survivors
                            were sold into slavery. The formerly Carthaginian
                            territories became the Roman province of Africa.
